REACT (Reasoning + Acting)

ReAct is a prompt-based architecture that enables LLMs (like GPT) to reason through problems and take actions by interleaving thoughts (reasoning) and actions (tool use or API calls).

Why REACT?
1. Traditional LLMs often hallucinate or lack memory/tool usage.
2. ReAct allows the model to:
   a.Think step-by-step (like Chain-of-Thought).
   b.Take actions (e.g., search, calculate, call APIs).
   c.Observe results, and reason again.
3.This creates a feedback loop for better task solving.

Core Components
1. Thoughts
2. Action
3. Observation.
4. Loop

Where its helpful?
1. RAG-based chatbots.
2.Autonomous agents (like AutoGPT, BabyAGI).
3.LangChain Agents.
4.Multi-step task solving
